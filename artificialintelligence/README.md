# Artifical Intelligence training focused on generative ai

The Artificial Intelligence training is a 2-hour session that is divided on two parts: theory and hands-on labs. 

In theory section there will be covered basics such as what is artificial intelligence and generative ai. Session delves deeper to understand how generative ai works itself, and how external data works with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). RAG is covered only in concept level. 

In hands-on lab section, we will deploy a web-application that can be connected to existing vector database.

## Training agenda

1. Artificial intelligence theory
    - What is AI?
    - Machine learning
    - Different AI solutions 
2. Generative AI theory
    - Models
    - External data
    - RAG
    - Plugins 
3. Hands-on lab
    - Create a web-application to use with large language models
    - Connect web-application to vector database
